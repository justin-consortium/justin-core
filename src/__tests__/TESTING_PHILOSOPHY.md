# Justin Testing Philosophy (All Packages)

This document defines **shared testing philosophy, patterns, and expectations**
across the Justin ecosystem.

Each package may add **package‑specific guidance**, but this file establishes the
common baseline so tests feel familiar no matter which Justin package you are in.

---

## Why We Test

Justin tests serve **three purposes**:

1. **Correctness** – the code does what it claims
2. **Design documentation** – tests explain intent and contracts
3. **Refactoring safety** – behavior can evolve without fear

A good Justin test teaches a future contributor *how the system works*.

---

## Core Principles

### 1) Tests Explain Intent

Test names should read like sentences:

> “Given this scenario, what should happen?”

**Good**
- `returns null when identifier is invalid`
- `logs and rethrows the same Error instance`
- `emits userUpdated after successful update`

**Bad**
- `test update`
- `misc edge case`
- `works fine`

If a test name doesn’t explain behavior, rewrite it.

---

### 2) Behavior Over Implementation

Tests should assert **observable behavior**, not internal structure.

Avoid brittle assertions like:

```ts
expect(ctx.error.stack).toBeDefined();
```

Prefer contract‑level assertions:

```ts
expect(ctx.error).toMatchObject({ message: 'boom' });
```

Internals may change — behavior should not.

---

### 3) Prefer Shared Helpers Over Ad‑Hoc Mocking

If you copy/paste test setup more than once, stop and ask:

> “Should this be a helper?”

Helpers improve:
- readability
- consistency
- long‑term maintainability
- reduces duplicate code

---

### 4) Unit Tests First, Integration Tests Intentionally

**Unit tests**
- Define intent
- Mock dependencies
- Fast, deterministic

**Integration / system tests**
- Validate assumptions
- Use real infrastructure *only when needed*
- Fewer in number, higher signal

---

### 5) Structure Tells the Story

Use a predictable structure:

1. **Top‑level `describe`** → module / class
2. **Nested `describe`s** → grouped behaviors
3. **Arrange → Act → Assert**

Example:

```ts
describe('findById', () => {
  it('returns null when the id is invalid', async () => {
    // arrange
    // act
    // assert
  });
});
```

---

## Tooling Standards (All Packages)

### Sinon for Mocks / Spies / Stubs

Justin standardizes on **Sinon**.

Avoid:
- `jest.fn()`
- `jest.spyOn()`
- `jest.useFakeTimers()`

Jest remains the **test runner and assertion library**.

---

## Helpers vs Testkits

Across Justin packages:

- **helpers/**
  - small utilities
  - assertion helpers
  - no global side effects

- **testkit/**
  - sandboxes
  - mock factories
  - coordinated stubbing of subsystems

Rule of thumb:
- *Utility → helper*
- *Environment / sandbox → testkit*

---

## When to Add a Helper

Add a helper when:
- setup repeats across multiple tests
- intent becomes clearer, not hidden

Do **not** add helpers that obscure behavior.

Avoid helpers that assert behavior.
- Helpers should prepare inputs or infrastructure, 
not define what “success” means. If a helper performs 
assertions, the test reader can no longer see which behaviors 
are important for that test case.

---

## Final Rule

If a test fails and the failure message does not immediately explain *what broke*,
the test is not done yet.
